# Problem Statement

Many beginners wanting to learn Python or basic programming concepts need simple, interactive projects that reinforce input handling, looping, and logic. The classic "Guess the Number Game" provides an engaging way to practice these fundamentals. The challenge is to create a program that generates a random number, accepts and validates user guesses, gives instant feedback, and tracks attempts until the correct answer is found.


# Scope of the Project

- Generate a random secret number between 1 and 100.
- Allow the user to repeatedly guess the number until solved.
- Validate input and prevent crashes from non-numeric entries.
- Give immediate feedback ("Too high", "Too low", "Correct!") for each guess.
- Track and display the number of attempts.
- Provide a congratulatory summary once completed.

Possible extensions include adding an attempt limit, allowing customization of the guessing range, or personalizing the experience with the user’s name.


# Target Users

- Students and beginners learning Python and programming basics.
- Educators needing a simple coding exercise for teaching control structures, input validation, and logic.
- Anyone who enjoys casual, interactive number games.

# High-Level Features

- Random secret number generation using the Python `random` module.
- Console-based user input and feedback loop.
- Input validation to handle non-integer/invalid entries.
- Attempt counting and result summary.
- Clear, user-friendly messages guiding the user through gameplay.
- Optionally customizable game settings (range, attempt limits, personalization).
